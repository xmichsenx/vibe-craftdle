# Changelog

All notable changes to the Craftdle project are documented in this file.

---

## [0.3.3] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed

- **Crafting grid layout**: Added `grid-rows-3` and `aspect-square` to ensure all cells are perfectly square regardless of content.
- **Crafting grid slot color**: Changed revealed ingredient cell background from `bg-mc-wood` (#BC9862 beige) to `bg-[#373737]` (dark gray), matching Minecraft's actual crafting table slot appearance.
- **Flaky test**: Fixed `craftingService` "decrements guesses remaining" test that failed when a random guess happened to be correct.

---

## [0.3.2] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed

- **Image aspect ratio**: added `object-contain` to `<img>` tags in `AutocompleteSearch.tsx` and `GameOverModal.tsx` so non-square images (e.g., mob textures) are no longer stretched/squished.
- **Missing image on crafting win screen**: `getCraftingAnswer` now looks up the item's real `textureUrl` and `wikiUrl` from `items.json` instead of returning a nonexistent local `/textures/` path.

---

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-26

### Changed

- **`npm run dev`** now uses colored, labeled output (`[server]` in blue, `[client]` in green) via `concurrently -n -c`.
- Added **`npm run start`** — builds both server and client, then runs them in production mode (Express + Vite preview) concurrently.
- Added **`npm run setup`** — one-command bootstrap: installs all dependencies (root, server, client) and fetches wiki data.
- Reordered `npm test` to run server tests before client tests.

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- **Comprehensive test suite**: 118 tests total (69 server + 49 client), all passing.
  - Server: `compare.test.ts` (6), `sessionService.test.ts` (14), `classicService.test.ts` (9), `craftingService.test.ts` (8), `textureService.test.ts` (8), `soundService.test.ts` (8), `routes.test.ts` (14 via supertest).
  - Client: `api.test.ts` (16), `useGame.test.ts` (14), `useAutocomplete.test.ts` (8), `components.test.tsx` (11 — GuessLimitSelector + GameLayout).
- **`useGame` generic hook** (`client/src/hooks/useGame.ts`): extracts all shared game state management (session, guesses, game over, error, answer) into a single reusable hook parameterized by `<TStartRes, TGuessRes>`. Used by all 4 game modes.
- **`GameLayout` component** (`client/src/components/common/GameLayout.tsx`): shared UI layout for start screen, in-game header, autocomplete, past guesses, and game over modal. Used by Crafting, Texture, and Sound modes.
- **`createGameRouter` factory** (`server/src/routes/createGameRouter.ts`): eliminates ~120 lines of duplicated Express route boilerplate across the 4 game mode route files.

### Changed

- **Server routes refactored**: `classicRoutes.ts`, `craftingRoutes.ts`, `soundRoutes.ts`, `textureRoutes.ts` each reduced from ~35 lines to ~12 lines by delegating to `createGameRouter`.
- **CraftingGame.tsx** refactored from ~170 lines to ~55 lines using `useGame` + `GameLayout`.
- **TextureGame.tsx** refactored from ~155 lines to ~57 lines using `useGame` + `GameLayout`.
- **SoundGame.tsx** refactored from ~130 lines to ~38 lines using `useGame` + `GameLayout`.
- **ClassicGame.tsx** refactored to use `useGame` hook (keeps custom layout for attribute feedback table).
- **`jest.config.cjs` (client)**: fixed typo `setupFilesAfterSetup` → `setupFilesAfterEnv`, added `moduleDirectories` for test resolution from `tests/client/`.
- **`jest.config.js` (server)**: added `moduleDirectories` for test resolution from `tests/server/`.
- **`fetch-data` npm script**: changed from `cd scripts && npx ts-node` to `npx ts-node scripts/fetch-wiki-data.ts` so `process.cwd()` resolves `server/data` correctly.

### Dependencies

- Added `supertest@7` and `mime@3` (server devDependencies) for HTTP route testing.

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- **Win animation**: confetti effect (canvas-confetti) fires from both sides with green/gold Minecraft-themed particles on correct guess. "🏆 You Win! 🏆" text with bounce animation.
- **Auto-redirect**: after winning, players automatically return to the home page after 4 seconds with a "Go Home Now" shortcut button.
- **Real wiki data**: `scripts/fetch-wiki-data.ts` fetches item/mob/recipe/sound data from the minecraft.wiki MediaWiki API (`api.php`).
  - 82 items with real Invicon texture URLs across 6 categories.
  - 22 mobs with wiki entity render images.
  - 37 real Minecraft crafting recipes.
  - 12 mob sounds with wiki OGG audio URLs.
  - 90 ingredient-to-icon URL mappings for crafting grid display.
- **Crafting Grid images**: 3×3 crafting grid now shows real Minecraft item Invicon images (from minecraft.wiki) instead of text labels when ingredients are revealed.
- **Texture Close-up real images**: uses CSS `background-image` cropping with real wiki texture URLs. Randomized crop center (centerX/centerY) for variety. Pixelated rendering for authentic Minecraft look.
- **Sound mode real audio**: plays actual mob sound OGG files from minecraft.wiki instead of placeholder descriptions.
- **Autocomplete thumbnails**: search dropdown shows 24×24 wiki Invicon thumbnails next to item names.
- **Mobile responsive design**:
  - Hamburger menu (☰/✕) for mobile navigation, auto-closes on link click.
  - Stacked guess limit selector on small screens.
  - Responsive crafting grid sizing.
  - Mobile-friendly scrollbar CSS.

### Changed

- `GameOverModal` redesigned: win state shows confetti + auto-redirect, loss state shows "Play Again" + "Back to Menu".
- `CraftingGrid` component accepts `ingredientIcons` prop for image display with text fallback.
- `TextureCrop` uses CSS background-position/background-size instead of canvas (avoids CORS issues).
- `SoundPlayer` uses `useRef` for persistent Audio element with play/stop toggle and pulse animation.
- `Header` component adds responsive mobile hamburger menu.
- Server `craftingService` includes `ingredientIcons` map in start/guess responses.
- Server `textureService` returns real `textureUrl` and random `centerX`/`centerY` in responses.
- `dataLoader` now loads `ingredientIcons.json` at startup.

### Dependencies

- Added `canvas-confetti` (client) for win animation effects.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- **Full project scaffolding**: monorepo with `client/` (React + Vite) and `server/` (Node.js + Express), both TypeScript.
- **Backend API server** (port 3001):
  - Express app with CORS, JSON body parsing, health check endpoint.
  - Data loader reads JSON files (items, mobs, biomes, recipes, sounds) into memory at startup.
  - Session management service with UUID-based game sessions and auto-cleanup.
  - Attribute comparison utility for Classic mode feedback.
  - 4 game mode services: Classic, Crafting, Texture, Sound — each with start/guess/answer logic.
  - REST routes for all 4 modes + autocomplete search endpoint (`/api/items/search?q=`).
- **Sample data files**: 10 items, 8 mobs, 5 biomes, 5 recipes, 5 sounds in `server/data/`.
- **Frontend React app** (port 5173 with Vite proxy to backend):
  - Tailwind CSS with Minecraft-themed dark design (pixel font, stone/dirt/grass palette).
  - Home page with mode selector cards (Classic, Crafting Grid, Texture Close-up, Sound).
  - Navigation header with links to all modes + footer with wiki attribution.
  - Autocomplete search component with debounced API calls.
  - Guess limit selector (Unlimited, 5, 10, 15, 20) for all modes.
  - Game over modal with answer reveal, wiki link, and "Play Again" button.
  - **Classic Mode**: attribute table with match/no-match coloring, guess history, give up.
  - **Crafting Grid Mode**: 3×3 grid with hidden "?" slots, progressive ingredient reveal.
  - **Texture Close-up Mode**: crop size display (4×4 → 16×16), zoom-out on wrong guess.
  - **Sound Mode**: play button, guess input, past guesses list.
  - React Router for SPA navigation between modes.
- **Configuration files**: `.gitignore`, `tsconfig.json` (client & server), `vite.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`, Jest configs.
- **Playwright MCP testing**: verified all 4 modes work end-to-end (start game, autocomplete search, submit guess, progressive feedback, give up/game over, play again).
