# Craftdle

A Minecraft-themed guessing game inspired by [Loldle](https://loldle.net). Identify items, blocks, and mobs across 7 different game modes. Fully static — no backend required.

Built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vite. Deployable on GitHub Pages.

## Game Modes

| Mode                 | Description                                                                                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Classic**          | Guess an item/block/mob by attribute feedback (type, dimension, behavior, stackable, renewable, version) |
| **Crafting Grid**    | Identify a craftable item from its recipe — ingredients are revealed one by one                          |
| **Texture Close-up** | Recognize an item from a zoomed-in crop of its 16×16 texture                                             |
| **Sound**            | Identify a mob by its sound effect                                                                       |
| **Silhouette**       | Identify a mob from a blacked-out silhouette that gradually reveals                                      |
| **Timeline**         | Guess whether the next entity was added in a higher or lower Minecraft version                           |
| **Reverse Crafting** | Given the output item, reconstruct the 3×3 crafting grid                                                 |

All modes support configurable guess limits (unlimited, 5, 10, 15, or 20).

## Architecture

All game logic runs client-side in the browser:

1. **Data Store** — Loads JSON files from `public/data/` via `fetch()` on startup
2. **Session Manager** — Tracks game sessions in memory (Map-based)
3. **Game Engines** — Each mode has `start()`, `guess()`, `getAnswer()` functions
4. **API Layer** — Async wrapper that ensures data is loaded, then delegates to engines

No server, no API calls — everything is self-contained in the browser.

## Data

Game data is sourced from [minecraft.wiki](https://minecraft.wiki) at build time via the `fetch-wiki-data.ts` script. Data files:

- `items.json` — Items and blocks with attributes (type, dimension, stackable, etc.)
- `mobs.json` — Mobs with behavior, dimension, sounds
- `recipes.json` — Crafting recipes (3×3 grids)
- `sounds.json` — Sound file references for mobs
- `biomes.json` — Biome data
- `ingredientIcons.json` — Texture URLs for crafting ingredients

Only the latest stable Minecraft version (1.21+) is included.

## Deployment

The app is configured for GitHub Pages with base path `/Craftdle/`.

```bash
# Build
npm run build

# Output is in client/dist/
# Deploy the contents of client/dist/ to GitHub Pages
```

The `404.html` SPA redirect handles client-side routing on GitHub Pages.

## Testing

```bash
npm test
```

Tests use Jest + React Testing Library. Test files are in `tests/client/`.

## Tech Stack

- **React 18** + **TypeScript** — UI framework
- **Vite** — Build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS** — Styling (Minecraft-inspired dark theme)
- **Jest** + **React Testing Library** — Testing
- **GitHub Pages** — Static hosting
